Analyze the CV based on the provided data.\n\n**INPUT VALIDATION (CRITICAL):** Before analysis, verify the text is a professional CV/Resume. It should ideally contain clear evidence of at least two of the following three core sections, regardless of language or specific headers: 1) Experience, 2) Education, or 3) Skills.\n\nIf the input lacks two core sections, do NOT return an error or stop. Instead, proceed with the analysis and in the output JSON, explicitly include this as a critical area for improvement with actionable advice to add missing sections.\n\n**Objective:** Provide a clear, actionable assessment to strengthen the CV, improve ATS pass-through rate, and increase interview chances.\n\n**Analysis Dimensions (MUST be covered):**\n1. Job Market Alignment (40%)\n2. ATS Optimization (40%)\n3. Competitive Positioning (20%)\n\n**Mandatory Output Structure:** The analysis MUST follow this strict JSON schema:\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"CV Analysis Report\",\n  \"overall_score\": {\n    \"label\": \"Overall ATS & Market Readiness Score\",\n    \"range\": \"0-100\",\n    \"score\": \"[CALCULATED SCORE HERE]\",\n    \"weighting_justification\": {\n      \"ATS Compatibility\": \"40%\",\n      \"Job Market Alignment\": \"40%\",\n      \"Competitive Differentiation\": \"20%\"\n    },\n    \"justification\": \"[2-3 sentence justification for the score, explaining primary factors.]\"\n  },\n  \"sections\": {\n    \"strengths\": [\"[List 3-5 strengths as strings]\"],\n    \"areas_for_improvement\": [\n      // if two or more core sections missing, include this as critical area, e.g.\n      \"CV is missing one or more core sections (Experience, Education, Skills), please add them to improve ATS compatibility and completeness.\",\n      \"[Other critical or less critical areas for improvement (3-5 items)]\"\n    ],\n    \"recommendations\": [\"[Clear, actionable recommendations — 5 to 7 items]\"]\n  }\n}\n\n**Crucially:** Do NOT generate or rewrite the CV itself here, only provide the analysis in the structured JSON format."
