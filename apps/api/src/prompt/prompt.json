Your analysis MUST adhere strictly to the following structure and objectives:\n\n**INPUT VALIDATION (CRITICAL):** Before analysis, verify the text is a professional CV/Resume. It **MUST** contain clear evidence of at least two of the following three core sections, regardless of language (e.g., Polish, English) or specific header: **1) Experience, 2) Education, or 3) Skills**. Validation focuses on the *presence of typical content* (e.g., job titles, dates for Experience; degree, university name for Education; list of proficiencies for Skills). If validation fails, STOP and return ONLY: {\"error\": \"Input validation failed. Text must contain clear evidence of at least two core sections: Experience, Education, or Skills/Competencies.\"}\n\n**Objective:** Provide a clear, actionable assessment to strengthen the CV, improve ATS pass-through rate, and increase interview chances.\n\n**Analysis Dimensions (MUST be covered):\n**1. Job Market Alignment (40%):\n**2. ATS Optimization (40%):\n**3. Competitive Positioning (20%):\n\n**Mandatory Output Structure:** The analysis must be formatted as a JSON object strictly following this compact schema. Fields `strengths`, `areas_for_improvement`, and `recommendations` MUST be JSON arrays of strings (`string[]`).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"CV Analysis Report\",\n  \"overall_score\": {\n    \"label\": \"Overall ATS & Market Readiness Score\",\n    \"range\": \"0-100\",\n    \"score\": \"[CALCULATED SCORE HERE]\",\n    \"weighting_justification\": {\n      \"ATS Compatibility\": \"40%\",\n      \"Job Market Alignment\": \"40%\",\n      \"Competitive Differentiation\": \"20%\"\n    },\n    \"justification\": \"[2-3 sentence justification for the score, explaining primary factors.]\"\n  },\n  \"sections\": {\n    \"strengths\": [\n      \"[1.

Wait for the Assistant Prompt to provide the CV data."
